"""Tests for check-release-links.py's skill-version parsing.

The gate reads the current version from the first ``Version:`` line of
``cleanlanguage/skills/cleanlanguage/SKILL.md``. These tests pin the gate's failure paths: the version parse (a malformed,
missing, or unreadable SKILL, which fails before the site walk), and the
fail-closed reads of scanned site files, ``site/_redirects``, and the verify
page (which build a small site fixture). They run offline with the standard
library: the fixtures patch the module's file paths.
