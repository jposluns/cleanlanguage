"""Lint: the orchestration sources carry no internal review-history labels.

A comment or docstring that names the review pass or the finding that once motivated it, such as
"(round 7)", "(fix round 16, M1)", "(F1)", "finding S3" or "claude QA round 10", or that credits
a model family with a finding, such as "codex reproduced" or "the gemini seed", means nothing to a
later reader and mixes numbering schemes. The text states the reason itself instead.

The test scans each file in SCANNED in two ways. Every physical line is matched against
LABEL_PATTERNS. Every prose block, which in a Python file is a run of comments on consecutive
lines or a string statement such as a docstring and elsewhere is a paragraph of consecutive
non-blank lines, is matched line by line against PROSE_PATTERNS as well, and then as one text with
all its line breaks joined against both sets, so a label spread over any number of lines is caught
and reported at the line where it starts. Docstrings are found with ast.get_docstring, so the
docstring of a one-line suite counts too. PROSE_PATTERNS holds the widened bare finding id, which
applies to prose only because code legitimately carries short identifiers such as the closure
value "C1". A match on a line in ALLOWLIST, the reviewed set of lines whose match is a
cross-reference to a named plan rather than a review label, passes. A scanned file that is
missing, unreadable or does not tokenize and parse is a failure, never a skip, and an allowlist
entry that no longer matches a scanned line is a failure too, so the allowlist cannot silently go
stale.

Run with --probe PATH... to apply the same scan to any files or directories, for example the
whole tools/ directory: it prints every hit and every unreadable file, and exits 1 when there is
one.

Residual: this lint is a best-effort guard, not a complete one. Its patterns are a denylist over
prose, and its residual is open-ended: a label in any phrasing, synonym or layout the patterns do
not list passes, and no list of known gaps can close that set. Completeness over the class of
review-history labels therefore rests on an independent search of the scanned files, not on this
lint. The known residual forms are these: a review pass named in words ("the third review"); a
round number after a colon that a letter follows, with or without a space between, as in "round:
7 decimal places", or that a decimal continuation follows, as in "round: 7.5"; a finding id
of three or more capital letters or of more than two digits; a finding id with a hyphen or a
letter suffix, such as "the F-1 case" or "the F1a case", anywhere outside parentheses and the
word "finding"; in prose, a bare id that follows "point " or starts with "PR" (the forms the
plan uses for its open points and pull-request slices), exclusions the code-line bare id pattern
does not make, so "point F1" is still caught on any line; a reviewer named other than as codex,
claude or gemini; a family name more than two words away from its review or credit word, or
credited by a verb outside REVIEW_WORD; in a Python file, a label split across two lines of a
string that is not a statement of its own, such as an argument or an assigned value, which is
matched line by line only; and a bare id in code that does not use one of the letters of the
code-line bare id pattern. The PatternSelfCheck case pins the forms the patterns are known to
cover and the ordinary code and prose they must not flag, so a pattern weakened or widened past
either set fails the suite.
